## World Building
GMs use classic methods to enter and store information about their campaign. Locations, Pantheons, NPCs, Orgnaizations etc. These entitties are stored as flexible articles with pre-defined templates tailored for each type of entity. Custom templates are also planned.
## Campaign Planning
GMs curate information from their world building and combine it in unique configurations to build *Campaigns*. a Campaign is organized around a style or principle. The Default campaign style is a **Spiral Campaign**, where the broad strokes are established up front, with *Fronts, Regions, 6 truths,* and *a broad goal* are established, and unfold session to session. starting with the characters, and spiraling out to larger and larger scope. 

## Session Planning
This is accomplished through *"Session Planning"*, a system where GMs make use of the information enterred when building their world and campaign. 

During Session Planning, GMs use various widgets to build a dashboard for their upcoming game session. This dashboard is organized using principles from Michael E. Shea's Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master, and other concepts, but is system agnostic.
